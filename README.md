# Homebridge GPIO

Supports triggering General Purpose Input Output (GPIO) pins on the Raspberry Pi.
Useful to control relay switch from siri

## Requirements
-	[Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) - _HomeKit support for the impatient_

## Installation
1.	Install Homebridge using `npm install -g homebridge`
2.	Install this plugin `npm install -g homebridge-gpio`
3.	Update your configuration file - see `sample-config.json` in this repo
4.	Install my forked version of [gpo-admin](https://github.com/quick2wire/quick2wire-gpio-admin) _(abandoned project)_:


```bash
git clone git://github.com/jamesblanksby/quick2wire-gpio-admin.git
cd quick2wire-gpio-admin
make
sudo make install
sudo adduser $USER gpio
```

## Configuration
Example `config.json`

```json
{
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "GPIO",
        "name": "GPIO4",
        "pin": 7,
        "duration": 4000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Pin Configuration
An extract from: [pi-gpio](https://github.com/rakeshpai/pi-gpio):

> This couldn't have been more confusing. Raspberry Pi's physical pins are not laid out in any particular logical order. Most of them are given the names of the pins of the Broadcom chip it uses (BCM2835). There isn't even a logical relationship between the physical layout of the Raspberry Pi pin header and the Broadcom chip's pinout. The OS recognizes the names of the Broadcom chip and has nothing to do with the physical pin layout on the Pi. To add to the fun, the specs for the Broadcom chip are nearly impossible to get!

> That gives you several GPIO pins to play with: pins 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 and 22 (with A+ and B+ giving 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 38 and 40). You should provide these physical pin numbers to this library, and not bother with what they are called internally. Easy-peasy.
